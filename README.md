# 📧 Phishing Email Detection using NLP

This project builds a machine learning model to detect phishing emails using text preprocessing and NLP.

---

## 📌 Objective
Classify emails as **phishing** or **legit** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. This demonstrates practical skills in AI applied to cybersecurity problems.

---

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: Public Kaggle dataset with real and fake email samples
- Merged and labeled for binary classification

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NLTK, scikit-learn)
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Google Colab
- Visualization (WordCloud, Seaborn)

---

## 🧠 Methods
- Cleaned text using stopword removal, tokenization, and regex
- Extracted features using TF-IDF
- Trained Naive Bayes model
- Evaluated with accuracy and confusion matrix

---

## 📊 Results
- Accuracy: **92.4%**
- Precise phishing detection using minimal features

---

## 📎 Usage
To run the notebook:
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Upload the phishing and legit email CSV files
3. Follow step-by-step comments to run preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
